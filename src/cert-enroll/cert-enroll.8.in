.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
.B cert-enroll
uses the strongSwan
.BR pki
command to request an initial X.509 certificate from a PKI server using either
the EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) or the SCEP (Simple Certificate
Enrollment Protocol) certificate enrollment protocol. After having received the
host certificate, its expiration date can be monitored periodically and a new
certificate will be automatically requested when a predefined deadline of
remaining validity days is reached. The generated RSA or EDCSA private key and
the downloaded X.509 certificate can then be installed in specific places on the
host via the
.BR cert-install.conf
installation script that can be customized to fit any application. The default
installation script copies the host key, the host certificate and the CA
certificates into the corresponding @sysconfdir@/swanctl/ subdirectories.
